About the Project

This project is a recreation of the classic Tetris game built entirely using Python. As my second Python project, it showcases both the timeless charm of Tetris and the fun of game development using Python.

Features:
- Classic Tetris Gameplay: The game includes all the essential elements of Tetris, from rotating and moving blocks to clearing lines and progressively increasing speeds.
- Colorful Graphics: The blocks are rendered in vibrant colors, providing a visually appealing experience.
- Keyboard Controls: Intuitive controls allow players to easily move, rotate, and drop blocks using the keyboard.

This project was a great way to explore game logic, event handling, and basic graphics programming in Python. I focused on creating a smooth, enjoyable experience that captures the addictive nature of the original Tetris.
